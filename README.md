# What's this about?
Just random Python scripts that I've made through writing ONLY comments or function names. All code was generated by GitHub Copilot
Exceptions to this are imports and lesser code tweaks, like variables that don't exist, and extremely basic code corrections (in case of the latter
,the code line will be commented with the message "TWEAKED")

# Ok, but why?
Honestly, just found it fun. Initially I was skeptical about GitHub's Copilot current usefulness (still am, a little bit), but I quickly realized it works
really well, at least in Python. I was playing around with it so much that I ended up writing no code, and just writing comments and function names to see
what it would do. That's when I had the idea "what if I can literally just type what I want a program to do and let Copilot do the rest?"

# Woah! That's awesome! Can it do that?
Well... kind of. Not without some serious babysitting. It does work much better than I expected. Not just by doing what you meant, but by actually
structuring code closely and implementing functionality that is similar to how you would do it. But rest assured, this is what programming probably will become in the future

# Babysitting? How much babysitting?
Depends. Not sure what it depends on, but it depends (that's deep learning, I guess). There are times where it would auto complete complex tasks surprisingly well, there are times
I thought it would be rather easy to implement what I specify, but Copilot struggled a bit.

For instance, I tested it on a script where I, very often, saved pandas
dataframes as csv, and, to my surprise, the generated code actually started doing the same thing, even though I didn't even include pandas or csv in function
names or comments, and it would even print things along the way that I would usually print while debugging!

On the other hand, trying to make it print a circle in ASCII ("def print_circle") wasn't at all possible without specifically adding an initial __doc__ string specifying it, and
Copilot would suggest functions that print triangles, squares, straight lines, zig zags, four vertices of a square, etc. but not a circle

# What about performance?
Anything that involves iterating over lists and such, you can expect it to suggest naive approaches. Numpy arrays are also often iterated over with for
loops (which have terrible performance), although Copilot does a good job of using packages, even if you're not importing them already, which makes performance comparable to
a typical approach that uses a package's API. You can usually tell just by looking at the suggested code if it will perform well or not.

# What about bad solutions? Are they usual?
Yes. Very. Very common bad solutions are functions that have an initial description but aren't actually implemented (some even have comments with "TODO"
followed by a pass statement), solutions which are just print statements (like def open_youtube() often leads to a suggestion that prints "Opening Youtube"
followed by "Done!" and that's it), and huge chains of if elses that could easily be written as a single line. Although these solutions are abundant, they're
usually very easy to dismiss and you can just focus on good solutions. There's also frequently a solution that simply consists in printing a bunch of
newlines, don't know what's up with that...
